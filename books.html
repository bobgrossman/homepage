<p>&#8220;<b>An intriguing study of data and how it has evolved, &#8216;The Structure of Digital Computing&#8217; is well worth considering, highly recommended.</b>&#8221; 
<br/>The Midwest Book Review</p>


<p>&#8220;<b>Fascinating insights into the past, present and future of computing.</b>&#8221; <br/>
Kirkus Reviews</p>


<p>&#8220;If you have ever wondered whether there is any structure beneath all the noise in the marketplace about computing, this is the book to read.&#8221;</br>
Stuart Bailey, Founder and CTO of Infoblox</p>

<p>&#8220;Reading this book will help you understand the basic concepts and trends that have shaped computing for the past half century and that will continue to do so for the forseeable future.&#8221;</br>
Joel J. Mambretti, Director of the International Center for Advanced Internet Research at Northwestern University</p>

<br/>

<p>The Structure of Digital Computing takes a fifty year perspective on computing and discusses what is significant, what is novel, what endures, and why it is all so confusing.  The book tries to balance two point of views: digital computing as viewed from a business perspective, where the focus is on marketing and selling, and digital computing from a research perspective, where the focus is on developing fundamentally new technology.</p>
<p>The book divides the last fifty years of computing into five eras and discusses some of the forces that transitions us from one era to another.</p>
<p>The book has five chapters:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Five Eras of Computing</li>
<li>Commoditization: Beyond Moore&#8217;s Law</li>
<li>Technical Innovation vs Market Clutter</li>
<li>Technology Adoption Cycles</li>
<li>The Era of Data </li>
</ol>
<p>Chapter 1 describes the first four eras of computing.  Chapter 5 is a non-technical introduction to  big data.  You can download both chapters from <a href="http://www.structureofdigitalcomputing.com">www.structureofdigitalcomputing.com</a> (see the tab labeled samples).  This site also contains some additional information about the book.</p>
						
<p>The book is available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Digital-Computing-Mainframes-ebook/dp/B00BH59AZ8">Amazon</a> and more information is available from the book&#8217;s web site <a href="http://www.structureofdigitalcomputing.com">structureofdigitalcomputing.com</a>.</p>
