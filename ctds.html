<p><b>The Center for Translational Data Science (<a href="https://ctds.uchicago.edu">CTDS</a>) 
at the University of Chicago is developing the discipline of data science and its applications to problems in biology, medicine, healthcare and the environment.</b></p>

<p>Today, CTDS develops and operate large scale data platforms to support research in cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Veterans’ health, pain management, and opioid use disorder, and environmental science.  </p>

<p>CTDS researchers are also developing new machine learning and AI algorithms over the data in the platforms it operates.</p>

<p>CTDS has developed a number of important “firsts:” including, one of the first large scale data clouds (the NSF supported Open Science Data Cloud (2010-2016)); the first data cloud designed to host biomedical data and approved as a NIH Trusted Partner (the Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud (2013-2020)); the first large scale data commons (the NCI Genomic Data Commons (2016-present)); and, one of the first data meshes for biomedical data (The Biomedical Research Hub (2021-present). </p>

<p>CTDS operated data commons include:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov">NCI Genomic Data Commons</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://bloodpac.org">BloodPAC Data Commons</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://ibdgc.datacommons.io/">NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Data Commons</a></li>
</ul>
